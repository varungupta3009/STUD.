<body>
	<p>Web technology refers to the means by which computers communicate with each other using markup languages and multimedia packages. It gives us a way to interact with hosted information, like websites. Web technology involves the use of hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS).

	Web technology is the development of the mechanism that allows two of more computer devices to communicate over a network. For instance, in a typical office setting, a number of computers plus additional devices such as printers may be interconnected via a network, allowing for quick and convenient transmission of information. The processes involved in web technology are complex and diverse, which is why major businesses employ whole departments to deal with the issue. Web technology has revolutionized communication methods and has made operations far more efficient.</p>
